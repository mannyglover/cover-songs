Am  D  G  C C/B x2
Am  D  Am  D
 
[Verse]
      Am        D
We're talking away
      G                 C      C/B
Well, I don't know what I'm to say
     Am        D
I'll say it anyway
  G              C      C/B
Today's another day to find you
Am       D
Shying away
Em                       C
I'll be coming for your love, ok?
 
[Chorus]
G      D    Em  C
Take   on   me (take on me)
G      D    Em  C
Take   me   on (take on me)
G      D    Em    C
I'll   be   gone
            G    D   Em   C
In a day or two...
 
[Verse]
   Am           D
So needless to say
    G              C        C/B
I'm odds and ends, but that's me I'm
   Am       D
Stumbling away
G                    C    C/B
Slowly learning that life is ok
Am        D
Say after me
Em                   C
It's no better to be safe than sorry
 
[Chorus]
G      D    Em  C
Take   on   me (take on me)
G      D    Em  C
Take   me   on (take on me)
G      D    Em    C
I'll   be   gone
            G    D    Em   C
In a day or two...

    Am                   D
Oh, the things that you say
      G             C       C/B
Yeah, is it life or just to play
   Am        D
My worries away?
       G                   C      C/B
You're all the things I've got to remember
       Am       D
You're shying away
Em                 C
I'll be coming for you anyway

In a day...

 I'll   be   gone
