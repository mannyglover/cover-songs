[Verse]
G     Em            C
Yesterday I went outside
        D             G
With my momma's mason jar
         Em           C  Riff 1
Caught a lovely butterfly
G      Em        C
When I woke up today
          D           G
Looked in on my fairy pet
          Em          C
She had withered all away
Riff 1                 D
No more sighing in her breast
 
 
[Chorus]
                     G
I'm sorry for what I did
      Em           C
I did what my body told me to
  D                     G
I didn't mean to do you harm
     G7              C      D       G
Everytime I pin down what I think I want
Riff 2    Em
It slips away
         C
There it goes slips away
 
 
[Verse]
G         Em             C
Smell you on my hand for days
        D              G
I can't wash away your scent
      Em                C riff 1
I'm a dog then you're a bitch
G         Em                C
  I guess you're as real as me
      D               G
Maybe I can live with that
      Em       C
Maybe I need fantasy
Riff 1                D
Life of chasing butterfly
 
 
[Chorus]
                     G
I'm sorry for what I did
      Em           C
I did what my body told me to
  D                     G
I didn't mean to do you harm
     G7              C      D       G
Everytime I pin down what I think I want
Riff 2    Em
It slips away
         C
There it goes slips away
 
 
[Verse]
G      Em              C
I told you I would return
         D               G
When the robin makes his nest
            Em      C   Riff 3
But I ain't never coming back
G              Em         C C/B  G
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry
